% NAME OF ACADEMIC UNIT
%
% The following two commands allow you to specify the academic unit you belong to.
% This will appear on the title page as
% ``<academic unit> of <department>''.
% So if you are in the division of biomedical engineering you would need to do:
% \department{Biomedical Engineering}
% \academicunit{Division}
%
% The default is ``Department of Computer Science'' if these commands
% are not given.
%
% If you are in a discipline other than Computer Science, uncomment the following line and
% specify your discipline/department.  Default is 'Computer Science'.
% \department{If not Computer Science, put the name of your department here}

% If you are not in a department, but say, a division, uncomment the following line.
% \academicunit{Put the type of academic unit you belong to here, e.g. Division, College}


% PERMISSION TO USE ADDRESS
%
% If you are not in Comptuer Science you will want to change the
% address on the Permission to Use page.  This is done using the
% \ptuaddress{}.  Example:
%
% \ptuaddress{Head of the Department of Computer Science\\
% 176 Thorvaldson Building\\
% 110 Science Place\\
% University of Saskatchewan\\
% Saskatoon, Saskatchewan\\
% Canada\\
% S7N 5C9

% ABSTRACT
\abstract{
The Internet of Things (IoT) can be seen as a large scale network of billions of smart devices. Often IoT devices exchange data in small but numerous messages, which requires IoT services to be more scalable and reliable than existing Web services. Traditional protocols that are known in Web world does not fit well in constrained environment that these devices operate in. Therefore many lightweight protocols specialized for the IoT have been studied, among which the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) stands out for its well-known REST paradigm and easy integration with existing Web. On the other hand, new paradigms such as Fog Computing emerges, attempting to avoid centralized bottleneck in IoT services by moving computations to the edge of the network. Since a node of the fog essentially belongs to a relatively constrained environment, CoAP fits in well. Among the many attempts of building scalable and reliable systems, Erlang as a typical concurrency-oriented programming (COP) has been battle tested in telecom industry, which has similar requirements as the IoT. In order to explore the possibility of applying Erlang and COP in general to the IoT, this thesis presents an Erlang based CoAP server/client prototype ecoap with a flexible concurrency model that can scale up to unconstrained environment like the cloud and scale down to constrained environment like an embedded platform. The flexibility of the presented server renders the same architecture applicable from  fog to cloud. To evaluate its performance, the proposed server is compared with the mainstream CoAP implementation on a Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud instance and a Raspberry Pi 3, representing the unconstrained and constrained environment respectively. The ecoap server achieves similar level of throughput as the other implementation in the cloud while outperforms it on the Raspberry Pi. It also shows in general better latency. The thesis yields positive results and demonstrates the value of the philosophy of Erlang in the IoT space.
